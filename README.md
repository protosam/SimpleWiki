# SimpleWiki
Extremely simple Wiki written in PHP that uses Markdown language for pages. Made for my notes and documentation. Currently it is `in development`.  
  
If you would like to play around with it, get the code, navigate to the `setup.php` script, and setup SimpleWiki.

## Todo List
- Admin user management
- Admin ability to block edits by IP/User 
- Track page revisions
- Restore page from prior version
- Page Listing system
